Hello,

I'm Nick & I live in London in the UK. :city_sunrise:

#### Background
I wanted to create software systems :computer: since I first used Visual Basic 6 ðŸ”¥. You have the power to make things. It's practical & creative; yet it's all logic-based - all controlled by some special words in a file. I recognised that this ability can help solve real problems & sustain an interesting work-life. This led to studying computer science & ultimately to wherever it is I am now!

Most of my experience is within large, complex enterprise technology environments with lots of stakeholders & dependency & competing concerns :clipboard::comet::office::rainbow::crystal_ball:. Through this & wider learning I value all activities that can impact value streams :rocket:. Organisational design, team interactions, improvement processes etc. where bottlenecks :champagne: can often be identified & carefully adjusted.

#### Now
I am consciously growing strong roots as a technical leader by learning, doing & sharing in a variety of avenues. Going in to the future this will allow me to pivot with my organisation, the industry & my own curiosity from a position of strength & confidence.

My current particular out-of-work learning focus is linux & security.

#### Skills
* Automation, cloud, containers, coding, linux, networking.
* Operations, security, observability, reliability, FinOps, DX.
* Coaching, collaboration, improvement, leadership.

#### Work
1. Engineering management.
1. Building & operating internal software *platforms*.
1. Infrastructure, operations, automation & non-functional requirements for custom software products.
1. Custom development related to the areas I work in.

#### Roles
Something with *Systems*, *Platform*, *SRE* or *DevOps* in the title.

#### Other
* I strongly advocate for continual, sustainable, incremental improvement as *generally* the best method to achieve any goal. 
* I'm a minimalist & am always looking to make things simpler, stabler, clearer & more impactful. 

Outside of computing I enjoy health :herb::muscle:, football :soccer:, reading :scroll: & lots of normal things :tv::cocktail:. I'm mainly concerned about living a balanced life :balance_scale: where my time :watch: is aligned with my values.


Thank you for taking the time! :beers:   
Nick.
