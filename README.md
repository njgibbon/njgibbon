Hello,

I'm Nick & I live in London in the UK :city_sunrise:.

I am a software reliability engineer & manager in cloud infrastructure, platforms & tools :wrench: heavily in to automation, operations, reliability & security. At any point in time my role will probably have something like *Platform* / *Reliability* / *DevOps* in the title. I'm also in to DX, FinOps :moneybag:, technical product management, collaboration, improvement, leadership & many other things. Really, I have always been unavoidably interested in e2e systems & delivery & am compelled to improve value streams wherever the impact is most meaningful. 

I try to continuously learn as I do believe knowledge is power :crystal_ball: & details matter. Current areas of interest include service mesh, networking, multi-cloud (Azure) & custom development related to kubernetes and automation use cases.

I'm versatile & pragmatic & am good at not getting too overwhelmed :cyclone: with big problem spaces, decomposing work & making architectural transitions with as little disruption as feasible.

As I get older & wiser 🧙 I'm less attached to particular tools & products in general but I do like working in & around the kubernetes ecosystem ☸️🌍.

I advocate for fair worker treatment & encourage a jolly :santa:, empathetic, sustainable environment.

Outside of technology I like dogs 🐕🐕‍🦺, health :herb::muscle:, football :soccer:, reading :scroll: & lots of normal things :tv::cocktail:.

Thank you for taking the time! :beers:   
Nick.
