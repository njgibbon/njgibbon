Hello,

I'm Nick & I live in London in the UK. :city_sunrise:

#### Background
I've wanted to work in Software Development :computer: since I first used Visual Basic 6 ðŸ”¥. Suddenly, you have the power to make things. It's practical & creative & yet it's all logic-based - all controlled by some special words in a text file. I quickly recognised that this ability can help solve problems and sustain an interesting work life. This led to studying Computer Science & ultimately to wherever it is I am now!

Most of my experience is within large, complex, multi-team, multi-vendor Technology Organisations with lots of stakeholders & dependency & competing concerns :clipboard::comet::office::rainbow::crystal_ball:. Through this & wider learning I value all activies that can impact value streams :rocket:. Organisational design, team interactions, improvement processes etc. where bottlenecks :champagne: can often be identified & carefully adjusted.

#### Skills (to varying degrees)
* Automation, Cloud (AWS), Kubernetes, Linux, Networking.
* Operations, Security, Observability, Reliability, DX.
* Mentoring, Collaboration, Improvement, Leadership.

#### Work
1. Building Internal Software *Platforms*.
1. Infrastructure, Automation and Non-Functional Requirements for Custom Software Products.
1. Custom Development related to my knowledge domains.

#### Other
* I strongly advocate for continual, sustainable, incremental improvement as *generally* the best method to achieve any goal. 
* I'm a minimalist and am always looking to make things simpler, stabler, clearer & more impactful. 

Outside of computing I enjoy fitness :muscle:, football :soccer:, reading :scroll: & all lots of normal stuff :tv:. I'm mainly concerned about living a balanced life :balance_scale: where my time :watch: is allgined with my values.


Thank you for taking the time! :beers:   
Nick.
