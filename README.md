Hello,

I'm Nick & I live in London in the UK. :city_sunrise:

#### Background
I wanted to create software systems :computer: since I first used Visual Basic 6 ðŸ”¥. You have the power to make things. It's practical & creative; yet it's all logic-based - all controlled by some special words in a file. I recognised that this ability can help solve real problems and sustain an interesting work-life. This led to studying computer science & ultimately to wherever it is I am now!

Most of my experience is within large, complex enterprise technology environments with lots of stakeholders & dependency & competing concerns :clipboard::comet::office::rainbow::crystal_ball:. Through this & wider learning I value all activities that can impact value streams :rocket:. Organisational design, team interactions, improvement processes etc. where bottlenecks :champagne: can often be identified & carefully adjusted.

#### Skills (to varying degrees)
* Automation, Cloud (AWS), Kubernetes, Linux, Networking.
* Operations, Security, Observability, Reliability, FinOps, DX.
* Mentoring, Collaboration, Improvement, Leadership.

#### Work
1. Engineering management.
1. Building internal software *Platforms*.
1. Infrastructure, automation and non-functional requirements for custom software products.
1. Custom development related to my knowledge domains.

#### Other
* I strongly advocate for continual, sustainable, incremental improvement as *generally* the best method to achieve any goal. 
* I'm a minimalist and am always looking to make things simpler, stabler, clearer & more impactful. 

Outside of computing I enjoy health :herb::muscle:, football :soccer:, reading :scroll: & lots of normal things :tv::cocktail:. I'm mainly concerned about living a balanced life :balance_scale: where my time :watch: is aligned with my values.


Thank you for taking the time! :beers:   
Nick.
