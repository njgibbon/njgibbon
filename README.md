Hello,

I'm Nick & I live in London in the UK. :city_sunrise:

I've wanted to work in software development since I first used Visual Basic 6 ðŸ”¥. Suddenly, you have the power to make things. It's practical & creative & yet it's all logic-based - all controlled by some special words in a text file. From there, it's only a short leap to recognising that this ability can help real people in lots of different & interesting ways. This led to studying Computer Science & ultimately to wherever it is I am now!

Most of my experience is within different large, complex, multi-team, multi-vendor IT organisations with lots of stakeholders & competing concerns :clipboard::office::crystal_ball::rainbow::comet:. Through this & wider learning I value any domain that improves values streams in an enterprise :rocket:. Organisational design, team interactions, communication channels, collaboration techniques, improvement processes etc. where bottlenecks :champagne: can often be identified & carefully adjusted.

TODO: Current specialism & interests.

* I strongly advocate for continual, sustainable, incremental improvement as *generally* the best method to achieve any goal. 
* I'm a minimalist and am always looking to make things simpler, clearer & more impactful. 
* I highly value learning & try to keep up with modern IT through a variety of mediums. 
* I enjoy maintaining my own blog & have found it so useful that I expect I will keep this up in some form or other for a very long time.

Outside of computing I enjoy fitness :muscle: & reading :scroll: & binge-watching :tv: & various normal things. I'm mainly concerned about living a balanced life :balance_scale: where my time :watch: is allgined with my values.

Thank you for taking the time! :beers:  
All the best!  
Nick.
