Hello,

I'm Nick & I live in London in the UK. :city_sunrise:

#### Background
I wanted to create software systems :computer: since I first used Visual Basic 6 üî•. You have the power to make things. It's practical & creative; yet it's all logic-based - all controlled by some special words in a file. I recognised that this ability can help solve real problems & sustain an interesting work-life. This led to studying computer science & ultimately to wherever it is I am now!

Most of my experience is within large, complex enterprise technology environments with lots of stakeholders & dependency & competing concerns :clipboard::comet::office::rainbow::crystal_ball:. Through this & wider learning I value all activities that can impact value streams :rocket:. Organisational design, team interactions, improvement processes etc. where bottlenecks :champagne: can often be identified & carefully adjusted.

#### Now
I am consciously growing strong roots üå≥ as a technical leader in a range of ways. Going in to the future this will allow me to most efficiently pivot with the industry, my organisation & my own curiosity. My intention is to soon double down on custom development & knowledge sharing. My current learning plan includes enterprise architecture, networking, multi-cloud, service mesh & GitOps.

#### Skills
* Automation, CICD, IAC, cloud, containers, coding, linux, networking.
* Operations, reliability, security, observability, performance, FinOps, DX.
* Coaching, collaboration, improvement, leadership.

#### Work
* Technical product management & engineering people management.
* Designing, building & operating internal software *platforms*.
* Infrastructure, operations, automation & non-functional requirements for custom software products.
* Custom development related to the areas I work in.

#### Good at
* Breaking down large, ambiguous problem spaces into workable units.
* Maintaining focus on value. Exercising good judgement on: what is *good enough*; when unplanned work needs to be adopted or resisted; effort / complexity vs value; when more information is needed to proceed.
* Identifying opportunities in sociotechnical systems. Finding quick wins. Creating workarounds, tactics, strategies. Technical debt management - particularly removing, cleaning, tidying.
* Performing & advocating for highly visible working practises as well as working with high diligence. Managing tasks, adding tests, explaining PRs, updating documentation, communicating widely etc. *No loose ends*!

#### Roles
Probably something with *Systems*, *Production*, *Platform*, *SRE* or *DevOps* in the title.

#### Other
* I strongly advocate for continual, sustainable, incremental improvement as *generally* the best method to achieve any goal. 
* I'm a minimalist & am always looking to make things simpler, stabler, clearer & more impactful. 

Outside of computing I like dogs üêïüêï‚Äçü¶∫, health :herb::muscle:, football :soccer:, reading :scroll: & lots of normal things :tv::cocktail:. I'm mainly concerned about living a balanced life :balance_scale: where my time :watch: is aligned with my values.


Thank you for taking the time! :beers:   
Nick.
