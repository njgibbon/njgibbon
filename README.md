Hello,

I'm Nick & I live in London in the UK. :city_sunrise:

I've wanted to work in software development since I first used Visual Basic 6 ( ðŸ”¥ ). Suddenly, you have the power to make things. It's practical & creative & yet it's all logic-based - it's all controlled by some special words in a text file. From there, it's only a short leap to recognising that this ability can help real people in lots of different & interesting ways. This led to studying Computer Science & ultimately to wherever it is I am now!

TODO: Rest of contents

Outside of computing I enjoy fitness :muscle: & reading :scroll: & binge-watching :tv: & lots of normal things. I'm mainly concerned about living a balanced life :balance_scale: where my time :watch: is allgined with my values.

Thank you for taking the time! :beers:  
All the best!  
Nick.
