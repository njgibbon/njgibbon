Hello,

I'm Nick & I live in London in the UK :city_sunrise:.

I am an engineer & manager in cloud infrastructure, platforms & tools :wrench: heavily in to automation, operations, reliability & security. At any point in time my role will probably have something like *Platform* / *Reliability* / *DevOps* in the title. I'm also in to DX, FinOps :moneybag:, technical product management, collaboration, improvement, leadership & many other things. Really I have always been unavoidably interested in e2e delivery & am compelled to help improve value streams however is needed. 

I try to continously learn as I do believe knowledge is power :crystal_ball: & details matter. My current learning plan involves service mesh, networking & multi-cloud. My intention is to soon double down on custom development & knowledge sharing.

I'm versatile & pragmatic & am good at not getting too overwhelmed :cyclone: with big problem spaces, decomposing work, & making architectural transitions with as little disruption as feasible.

As I get older & wiser 🧙 I'm less attached to particular tools & products in general but I do like working in & aroud the kubernetes ecosystem ☸️🌍.

Outside of technology I like dogs 🐕🐕‍🦺, health :herb::muscle:, football :soccer:, reading :scroll: & lots of normal things :tv::cocktail:.

Thank you for taking the time! :beers:   
Nick.
